# land-cover-classification
Steps for running the modules: 
1. Clone this github repo
2. Inside the land-cover-classification directory, make the following new empty directories: data, output.
3. The structure of the entire directory must now look something like this:
<pre>
â”œâ”€â”€ land-cover-classification
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ config
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ data
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ logs
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ models
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ notebooks
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ output
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ src
</pre>
4. Download Version 1 LandCover AI dataset from : https://landcover.ai.linuxpolska.com/
5. The dataset that you have just downloaded must be extracted in the "data" folder of "land-cover-classification".
6. The structure of the data directory must look something like this:
<pre>
â”œâ”€â”€ data
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ test
â”‚ â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ images
â”‚ â”‚ â””â”€â”€ masks
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ test2
â”‚ â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ images
â”‚ â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ masks
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ train
â”‚ â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ Patches_512 (*this is the dataset that you have downloaded)
â”‚ â”‚ â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ images
â”‚ â”‚ â”‚ â””â”€â”€ masks
</pre>
7. You may choose to train the model. However, the models have already been saved in the models/ directory.
8. pip install -r requirments.txt
9. In the test/ and tes2/ directories, you may put some test datasets.
10. To run the tests, cd into src/
11. Run: python test2.py
12. Note that all the required directories must already be created.
13. To view the output, go to output/ -> Here, you will observe the plots corresponding to the test dataset depicting the semantic land segmeneation of aerial images.
