# land-cover-classification
Steps for running the modules: 
1. Clone this github repo
2. Inside the land-cover-classification directory, make the following new empty directories: data, logs, output.
3. The structure of the entire directory must now look something like this:
   config 
   data 
   logs
   models
   notebooks
   output
   src
4. Download Version 1 LandCover AI dataset from : https://landcover.ai.linuxpolska.com/
5. The dataset that you have just downloaded must be extracted in the "data" folder of "land-cover-classification".
6. The structure of the data directory must look something like this:
   data
   |
   -> test
   |
   ------> images
   ------> masks
   -> test2
   |
   ------> images
   ------> masks
   -> train
   |
   ------> patches_512 (*this is the dataset that you have downloaded)
   |
   --------------> images
   --------------> masks
7. You may choose to train the model. However, the models have already been saved in the models/ directory.
8. pip install -r requirments.txt
9. In the test/ and tes2/ directories, you may put some test datasets.
10. To run the tests, cd into src/
11. Run: python test2.py
12. Note that all the required directories must already be created.
13. To view the output, go to output/ -> Here, you will observe the plots corresponding to the test dataset depicting the semantic land segmeneation of aerial images.
